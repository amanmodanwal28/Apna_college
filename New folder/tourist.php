        <p style="font-size: 18px; "> The serial site, situated in the state of Rajastahan, includes six majestic
            forts in Chittorgarh; Kumbhalgarh; Sawai Madhopur; Jhalawar; Jaipur, and Jaisalmer. The ecclectic
            architecture of the forts, some up to 20 kilometres in circumference, bears testimony to the power of
            the Rajput princely states that flourished in the region from the 8th to the 18th centuries. Enclosed
            within defensive walls are major urban centres, palaces, trading centres and other buildings including
            temples that often predate the fortifications within which developed an elaborate courtly culture that
            supported learning, music and the arts. Some of the urban centres enclosed in the fortifications have
            survived, as have many of the site's temples and other sacred buildings. The forts use the natural
            defenses offered by the landscape: hills, deserts, rivers, and dense forests.<a href="chittor.php">

        Kashmir valley

        <p style="font-size: 23px; ">Jammu & Kashmir tourism has been described as a paradise so many times that one
            feels it is the ultimate homage you could pay to it. But somehow, there is a vagueness in it which does
            not do justice to this part of the country.

            What is paradise in Jammu & Kashmir? It is its alpine meadows, crystal clear lakes, amber hues of the
            trees during autumn, boathouses, gondolas, apple orchards and everything else that is a part of its
            landscape.

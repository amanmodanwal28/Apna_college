        <p class="paragraph">Jammu & Kashmir tourism has been described as a paradise so many times that one
            feels it is the ultimate homage you could pay to it. But somehow, there is a vagueness in it which does not
            do justice to this part of the country.

            What is paradise in Jammu & Kashmir? It is its alpine meadows, crystal clear lakes, amber hues of the trees
            during autumn, boathouses, gondolas, apple orchards and everything else that is a part of its landscape.

            amidst most picturesque horizons of Jammu. Once the residential palace of Raja Amar Singh, the palace has

            precincts is a temple dedicated to the Hindu goddess Kali, the presiding deity of Jammu. The temple is known
            locally as the “Bawey Wali Mata temple”. Just beneath the fort is the terraced Bagh-e-Bahu Garden laid in

        <p sclass="paragraph">
            Akhnoor Fort
            The Fort was built during the early 19th century and commands a towering view along the right bank of the
            Chenab. The present fort was probably started in 1762 AD at the behest of Raja Tegh Singh, as an autonomous
            principle state. A devastating famine is said to have broken in the country during this time. In order to
            provide work to his famishing people Raj Tegh Singh started the construction of Akhnoor Fort and Palace on
            banks of the Chenab River. He supplied food to the workers for 2 years and thus saved the principality His
            son Alam Singh completed the Akhnoor fort in 1802. On the eastern side, there are steps leading down to the
            River Chenab. Though constructed in the 18th century, most of the steps are in a good state of preservation.
            The ghat served as the important spot for performance of religious sites by the people of the region. The
            turrets or Burj are still intact is called the Kishore Singh Burj after Maharaja Gulab Singh’s father who
            was a close associate of Guru Gobind Singh the 10th Sikh Guru. There are traces of paintings on the walls of
            the rooms of the fort.

            have been founded by Amba Jagdev Pawar . A scion of Pawar dynasty of Dhar Ujjain which seems to have been

            goddess Durga. The name got changed gradually into Ambaran. Ambaran is the eighth place in the world, where

            important centre of Buddhism between the 1st and 7th century B.C. A cultural sequence of four historical
            periods has already been unraveled at Ambaran. It is believed to be the only early Buddhist site in Jammu

                Chittorgarh was one of the most fiercely contested seats of power in India. With its formidable
                fortifications, Bappa Rawal, the legendary founder of the Sisodia dynasty, received Chittor in the

            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                From the eighth to the 16th century, Bappa Rawal's descendants ruled over an important kingdom called
                Mewar
                stretching from Gujarat to Ajmer. But during these eight centuries the seemingly impregnable Chittor was
                surrounded, overrun, and sacked three times.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                In 1303 Allauddin khilji, Sultan of Delhi, intrigued by tales of the matchless beauty of Padmini, Rani
                of
                Chittor, of her wit and charm, decided to verify this himself. His armies surrounded Chittor, and the
                sultan
                sent a message to Rana Rattan Singh, Padmini's husband, to say that he would spare the city if he could
                meet
                its famous queen. The compromise finally reached was that the sultan could look upon Padmini's
                reflection if
                he came unarmed into the fort. Accordingly, the sultan went up the hill and glimpsed a reflection of the
                beautiful Padmini standing by a lotus pool. He thanked his host who courteously escorted Allauddin down
                to
                the outer gate-where the sultan's men waited in ambush to take the rana hostage.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                There was consternation in Chittor until Padmini devised a plan. A messenger informed the sultan that
                the
                rani would come to him. Dozens of curtained palanquins set off down the hill, each carried by six humble
                bearers. Once inside the Sultan's camp, four well-armed Rajput warriors leaped out of each palanquin and
                each lowly palanquin bearer drew a sword.In the ensuing battle, Rana Rattan Singh was rescued-but 7,000
                Rajput warriors died. The sultan now attacked Chittor with renewed vigor. Having lost 7,000 of its best
                warriors, Chittor could not hold out. Surrender was unthinkable. The rani and her entire entourage of
                women,
                the wives of generals and soldiers, sent their children into hiding with loyal retainers. They then
                dressed
                their wedding fine , slid their farewells, and singing ancient hymns, boldly entered the mahal and
                performed
                jauhar.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The men, watching with expressionless faces, then donned saffron robes, smeared the holy ashes of their
                women on their foreheads, flung open the gates of the fort and thundered down the hill into the enemy
                ranks,
                to fight to the death.The second sack or shake (sacrifice) of Chittor, by which Rajputs still swear when
                pledging their word, occurred in 1535, when Sultan Bahadur Shan Of Gujarat attacked the fort.

            <h2>Rana Kumbha</h2>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Rana Kumbha (1433-68) was a versatile man a brilliant, poet and musician. He built mewar upto a position
                of
                assailable military strength building a chain of thirty forts that girdled the kingdom But, perhaps more
                important was a patron of the arts to rival Lorenzo de Medici, and he made Chittorgarh a dazzling
                cultural
                center whose fame spread right across Hindustan.

            <h2 class="paragraph_point">Rana Sanga</h2>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Rana Sanga (reigned 1509-27) was a warrior and a man of great chivalry and honor reign was marked by a
                series of continual battles, in course of which he is said to have lost one arm and had been crippled in
                one
                leg and received eighty-four wounds on his body. The last of his battles was again Mughal invader,
                Babur, in
                1527. Deserted by one ofgenerals, Rana Sanga was wounded in the battle and shortly after.

            <h2>Maharana Pratap</h2>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Over the next half-century, most other Rajput rulers allowed themselves to be wooed the Mughals; Mewar
                alone
                held out. In 1567 Emperor Akbar decided to teach it a lesson: he attacked Chittorgarh razed it to the
                ground. Five years later Maharana Pratap (reigned 1572-97) came to rule Mewar - a king without a
                capital. He
                continued to defy Akbar, and in 1576, confronted the imperial armies at Haldighati.

                The battle ended in a stalemate and Maharana Pratap and his followers withdrew to the craggy hills of
                Mewar,
                from where they continued to harrass the Mughals through guerilla warfare for the next twenty years.
                Maharana Pratap made his descendants vow that they would not sleep on beds, nor live in palaces, nor eat
                off
                metal utensils, until Chittorgarh had been regained.In fact, right into the 20th century the maharanas
                of
                Mewar continued to place a leaf platter under their regular utensils and a reed mat under their beds in
                symbolic continuance of this vow.

            <h2>Rani Padmawati </h2>
            <p class="paragraph">

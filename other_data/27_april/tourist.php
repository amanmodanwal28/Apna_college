            <p class="paragraph"> The serial site, situated in the state of Rajasthan, includes six majestic
                forts in Chittorgarh; Kumbhalgarh; Sawai Madhopur; Jhalawar; Jaipur, and Jaisalmer. The ecclectic
                architecture of the forts, some up to 20 kilometres in circumference, bears testimony to the power of
                the Rajput princely states that flourished in the region from the 8th to the 18th centuries. Enclosed
                within defensive walls are major urban centres, palaces, trading centres and other buildings including
                temples that often predate the fortifications within which developed an elaborate courtly culture that
                supported learning, music and the arts. Some of the urban centres enclosed in the fortifications have
                survived, as have many of the site's temples and other sacred buildings. The forts use the natural
                defenses offered by the landscape: hills, deserts, rivers, and dense forests.<a href="chittor.php">

            <p class="paragraph">Jammu & Kashmir tourism has been described as a paradise so many times that one
                feels it is the ultimate homage you could pay to it. But somehow, there is a vagueness in it which does
                not do justice to this part of the country.

                What is paradise in Jammu & Kashmir? It is its alpine meadows, crystal clear lakes, amber hues of the
                trees during autumn, boathouses, gondolas, apple orchards and everything else that is a part of its
                landscape.

            <p class="paragraph">India is a remarkable tourist destination that offers a plethora of
                experiences to travellers. From the grandiose Taj Mahal, one of the wonders of the world, to opulent
                palaces and forts, India displays a variety of heritage riches that were crafted hundreds of years ago.

                As its bustling bazaars promise to give you the shopping experience of a lifetime, its serene natural
                retreats assure a scenic respite from the din. The various wildlife sanctuaries and national parks,
                along with adventure sports opportunities add to the thrill of a holiday. India is a delightful place
                with lots to explore and discover.<a href="tajmahal.php">&nbsp;More Info</a> </p>
